## Usage

### Installation
To install project dependencies execute:
  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ```
### Run tests
To run tests execute:
* Unit tests:
  ```
  npm run unit:test
  ```
* Integration tests:
  ```
  npm run it:test
  ```
* All tests:
  ```
  npm test
  ```

### Run application

#### Locally
To run application locally:
1. Up necessary services:
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
   ```
   Note: to stop services when they are not necessary run:
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml down
   ```
2. Execute the app:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   
   **Note:** To automatically restart app when some changes are made, then run next command instead of previous one:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

#### As docker container
To run application in a docker container execute:
```
npm run dockerize
```
Note: to stop application in container when not necessary then run:
```
docker-compose down
```

#### Checking application is running
In both cases, [locally](#locally) and [As docker container](#as-docker-container) you can use [openapi definition](./apis/rest/openapi-v1.yml) or [Postman collection](./postman/products API.postman_collection.json) to test running application.

* **Openapi**: open `openapi-v1.yml` content in [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and select `localhost` server and execute endpoints you want.
* **Postman**: select `TFM-products-local-env` environment variable. Execute postman collection:
  * **Manually**: Set values you want in the endpoint body and run it.
  * **Automatically**: Set values to `adminToken`, `userToken` and `productName` variables, and execute [Postman Collection Runner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).

**NOTE:** If the containers are not accessible via localhost, it will be necessary to use ${DOCKER_HOST_IP} instead of localhost. To do this, give a value to the variable:
```
export DOCKER_HOST_IP=127.0.0.1
```
For Mac:
```
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.200.10.1/24  # (where 10.200.10.1 is some unused IP address)
export DOCKER_HOST_IP=10.200.10.1
```

## Contributing
To contribute to this project have in mind:
1. It was developed using [TBD](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), so only main branch exists, and is necessary that every code pushed to remote repository is ready to be deployed in production environment.
2. In order to ensure the right style and code conventions, and that code to commit and push is ok, this project use __pre-commit and pre-push git hooks__. This is implemented using [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/).
Exists a [.husky](.husky) folder in project that contains the script to be executed in each hook.
   * **pre-commit:** This hook run eslint and unit tests, and if fails, changes can't be commited.
   * **pre-push:** This hook launch integration tests, and in case of failure, commits won't be pushed to remote branch. In case of is a tag push, it doesn't launch tests, instead it check that the tag match with the package.json version.
3. The API First approach was used, so please, if is necessary to modify API, in first place you must modify and validate [openapi definition](./apis/rest/openapi-v1.yml), and later, perform the code changes.
4. Every code you modify or add must have a test that check the right behaviour of it (As a future task we'll add sonar to ensure there is a minimum coverage).


## Deployment
This project has two available environments:
* Preproduction (PRE): Used to test the application previously to release it in a productive environment. This environment is accessible via API Gateway in the URL https://apigw-tfm-dev-amartinm82.cloud.okteto.net.
* Production (PRO): productive environment. Accesible in URL https://apigw-tfm-amartinm82.cloud.okteto.net.

The mechanism used to deploy the application in any of the previous environment is via github actions, that are defined in workflows in folder [.github/workflows](.github/workflows).
For this mechanism to work, it is necessary to add the following action secrets to the github repository:
* **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: AWS access key identifier.
* **AWS_DYNAMO_ENDPOINT**: AWS dynamodb endpoint.
* **AWS_REGION**: AWS region.
* **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: AWS secret access key.
* **DOCKERHUB_TOKEN**: Token used to publish docker images in Dockerhub.
* **DOCKERHUB_USERNAME**: username used to publish docker images in Dockerhub.
* **KUBECONFIG**: kubeconfig of the k8s cluster where deploy the microservice.

### PRE
When a push is done on remote branch (or a PR), github actions jobs defined in [ci-cd.yml](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) will be fired. All the jobs depends o the previous one, so if one of them fails, the project won't be deployed in the PRE environment:
   * **eslint**: Analyzes source code in the branch, if exists style errors fails.
   * **tests**: Run unitary and integration tests in the branch.
   * **publish-image**: Publish Docker image `tfm-products` with tag `trunk` in [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/).
   * **deploy**: Deploy the previous generated image in PRE k8s cluster. For this, it uses the helm chart defined in [helm/charts](./helm/charts/) folder.

So, when we push in the main branch, because of the action execution, it results in if our code is right formatted, and works because it pass the tests, it is deployed and running on a k8s cluster of PRE environment.

As a note, in PRE environment, helm chart variables are passed to create a Dynamodb container with persistent volume that can't be removed.

### PRO
#### Generate and deploy a new release
To deploy in PRO environment is necessary to generate a new release. To do that, execute:
```
npm run release
```    
It will tag the soure code with the current version of [package.json](./package.json), and push tag in remote repository.

Due to the new tag is pushed, the workflow defined in [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) is executed. It has several jobs:
  * **check-tag**: Verifies if pushed tag match with package version.
  * **publish-package**: Depends on previous job. Publish npm package version in github packages repository.
  * **publish-release**: Depends on previous job. Publish the release in github.
  * **publish-image**: Depends on previous job. Generate docker image of app, tagging it with `latest` and  `{pushed_tag}` (i.e: if we generated the tag 1.2.0. it tag the new image with 1.2.0), and publishing them in [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/).
  * **deploy**: Depends on previous job. It deploys application in PRO k8s cluster using `{pushed_tag}` image. For this, it uses the helm chart defined in [helm/charts](./helm/charts/) folder.
  *  **bump-version**: It depends on `publish-release` job, so is executed parallelly with `publish-release`. It increments the package version and update the remote repository, to avoid version conflicts during the development.

#### Deploy existing release
To deploy an existing release you can execute in github manual workflow defined in [manual-release-deploy.yml](.github/workflows/manual-release-deploy.yml).
Select main branch (the only one that exists), and introduce the release to deploy in the input. The release will be deployed in PRO environment.

As a note, in PRO environment, helm chart is called with `dynamodb.create` disabled, so a Dynamodb container is not created, and application point againts a Dynamodb service.

### Checking application is deployed
Like in [Usage > Run application > Checking application is running](#checking-application-is-running) you can check if the application is successfully deployed using Openapi definition or Postman collection. 
* **Openapi**: open `openapi-v1.yml` content in [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and select https://apigw-tfm-dev-amartinm82.cloud.okteto.net or https://apigw-tfm-amartinm82.cloud.okteto.net server and execute endpoints you want.
* **Postman**: select `TFM-products-pre-env` or `TFM-products-pro-env` environment variable. Execute postman collection as described in [Usage > Run application > Checking application is running](#checking-application-is-running).
